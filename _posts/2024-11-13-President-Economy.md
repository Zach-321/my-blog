I don't know if you knew this, but the election just happened. During every election, media organizations conduct exit polls to learn what type of people voted for each candidate and why. One of the most interesting questions asked in these polls is "Who do you trust to run the economy better?" In 2024[https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-elections/exit-polls]


Exit polls say that 52% of people trust Trump more on the economy and 46% say Harris. In 2020 it was 49-49 in 2016 it was 48-46 Trump in 2012. So it seems that voters generally favor republicans on the economy than democrats. But is that actually backed by history? That is what I want to find out. Is the economy better under Democratic presidents or Republican presidents? I have put together some benchmarks for economic data from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) API. FRED is the place to go for numbers on the economy, so it was an easy choice to pick once I had my question. The FRED API {DOC} is also pretty straightforward so it was a pretty painless process getting my data.
